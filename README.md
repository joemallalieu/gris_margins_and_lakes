README for GitHub joemallalieu/gris_margins_and_lakes
Updated: 2 May 2024

This file contains ice-margin boundaries (polylines) and ice-marginal lake outlines (polygons) for the southwestern sector of the Greenland ice sheet for the years 1992 and 2015.

These data can be used to visualise ice-margin recession in southwest Greenland and the formation of new - and expansion of existing - ice-marginal lakes into areas vacated by the ice sheet over a 23-year period. The data are provided as part of the student activities recommended in the publication: Harpur et al. (in prep) Increasing importance of ice-marginal lakes across Greenland. Journal title, volume no., pages, DOI. For more details regarding the activities please consult the publication.

All data can be dowloaded as a zip folder, along with this readme file, by clicking on the green '<> Code' button (top right of the page), then clicking 'Download ZIP'. You will need to unzip the folder (in Windows right click on the .zip folder and select 'Extract all') before proceeding.

For viewing, the ice-sheet boundaries and ice-marginal lake outlines will need to be imported into a Geographical Information System (GIS). QGIS (www.qgis.org) is a free open-source GIS suitable for this purpose, and can be supplemented with the QGreenland package (www.qgreenland.org), which compiles key environmental datasets for Greenland. To import the ice-sheet boundaries and ice-marginal lake outlines, the respective shapefiles (file extensions ending in .shp) can simply be dragged and dropped into QGIS, or imported directly into QGIS using the Data Source Manager for vector data. Note the files with corresponding names but different file name extensions (e.g. sbx, .prj etc.) are required for the GIS to read and present the shapefiles correctly. These files need to be downloaded and saved in the same folder as the shapefiles, but they themselves do not need to be imported into the GIS. There are many accessible tutorials and videos online explaining how to import and present data in QGIS.

The ice-sheet boundaries and ice-marginal lake data were classified from Landsat imagery. The full methodology, wider dataset (including data for the years 1987, 2000, 2005, 2010), and associated analyses are presented in: Mallalieu et al. (2021) Ice-marginal lakes associated with enhanced recession of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Global and Planetary Change, 202, 103503. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloplacha.2021.103503.

Any use of the ice-sheet boundaries and ice-marginal lake data in this file for academic or commercial research should cite Mallalieu et al. (2021) using the citation above.
